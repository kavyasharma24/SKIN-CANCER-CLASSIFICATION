# SKIN-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION 🧑‍⚕️🔬

A deep learning based web application for **Skin Cancer Classification** using **TensorFlow.js** and **React**.  
The app allows users to upload a skin lesion image and predicts whether it is cancerous or not.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload skin lesion image and get instant prediction.
- Pre-trained deep learning model integrated with TensorFlow.js.
- Simple and clean UI for better user experience.
- Real-time confidence percentage shown along with prediction.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow.js
- **Styling**: CSS / Tailwind (if used)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
